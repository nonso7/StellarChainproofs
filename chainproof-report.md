### Vulnerability Findings

#### 1. 🔴 [CRITICAL] Reentrancy vulnerability

- **ID:** `CP-107` ([SWC-107](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-107))
- **Location:** Line 41

**Description**

Function "withdraw" makes an external call before updating state variables. An attacker can re-enter the function before the state is updated, potentially draining funds (e.g. the DAO hack).

**Recommendation**

Apply the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern: update all state variables before making any external calls. Alternatively, use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard modifier.

**Affected Code**

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // ❌ External call BEFORE state update — classic reentrancy
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");

        // State updated AFTER call — attacker can re-enter before this line
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalDeposited -= amount;
    }
```

#### 2. 🔴 [CRITICAL] Reentrancy vulnerability

- **ID:** `CP-107` ([SWC-107](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-107))
- **Location:** Line 59

**Description**

Function "sendReward" makes an external call before updating state variables. An attacker can re-enter the function before the state is updated, potentially draining funds (e.g. the DAO hack).

**Recommendation**

Apply the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern: update all state variables before making any external calls. Alternatively, use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard modifier.

**Affected Code**

```solidity
function sendReward(address recipient) external onlyOwner {
        // ❌ .send() return value ignored — failure is silently swallowed
        recipient.call{value: rewardPool}("");
        rewardPool = 0;
    }
```

#### 3. 🔴 [CRITICAL] Reentrancy vulnerability

- **ID:** `CP-107` ([SWC-107](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-107))
- **Location:** Line 66

**Description**

Function "transferOwnership" makes an external call before updating state variables. An attacker can re-enter the function before the state is updated, potentially draining funds (e.g. the DAO hack).

**Recommendation**

Apply the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern: update all state variables before making any external calls. Alternatively, use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard modifier.

**Affected Code**

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external {
        require(tx.origin == owner, "Not owner");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
```

---

#### 4. 🟠 [HIGH] Use of tx.origin for authentication

- **ID:** `CP-115` ([SWC-115](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-115))
- **Location:** Line 29

**Description**

tx.origin refers to the original external account that initiated the transaction, not the immediate caller. A phishing contract can exploit this to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.

**Recommendation**

Replace tx.origin with msg.sender for authorization checks. If you need to distinguish EOAs from contracts, use msg.sender == tx.origin as a secondary check, not the primary guard.

**Affected Code**

```solidity
require(tx.origin == owner, "Not owner");
```

---

#### 5. 🟠 [HIGH] Use of tx.origin for authentication

- **ID:** `CP-115` ([SWC-115](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-115))
- **Location:** Line 67

**Description**

tx.origin refers to the original external account that initiated the transaction, not the immediate caller. A phishing contract can exploit this to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.

**Recommendation**

Replace tx.origin with msg.sender for authorization checks. If you need to distinguish EOAs from contracts, use msg.sender == tx.origin as a secondary check, not the primary guard.

**Affected Code**

```solidity
require(tx.origin == owner, "Not owner");
```

---

#### 6. 🟡 [MEDIUM] Unchecked call return value

- **ID:** `CP-104` ([SWC-104](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-104))
- **Location:** Line 61

**Description**

.call() and .send() return a boolean indicating success. Ignoring this return value means failures are silently swallowed, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

**Recommendation**

Always check the return value: `(bool success, ) = addr.call{value: amount}(""); require(success, "Transfer failed");`. Prefer .transfer() for simple ETH sends if reentrancy is not a concern.

**Affected Code**

```solidity
recipient.call{value: rewardPool}("");
```
